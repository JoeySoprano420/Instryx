## Reporting a Vulnerability

The Instryx team takes security vulnerabilities seriously. We appreciate your efforts to responsibly disclose your findings, and will make every effort to acknowledge your contributions.

### How to Report

**Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

Instead, please send an email to: security@instryx.dev (or create a private security advisory on GitHub)

You should receive a response within 48 hours. If for some reason you do not, please follow up via email to ensure we received your original message.

Please include the requested information listed below (as much as you can provide) to help us better understand the nature and scope of the possible issue:

- Type of issue (e.g. buffer overflow, SQL injection, cross-site scripting, etc.)
- Full paths of source file(s) related to the manifestation of the issue
- The location of the affected source code (tag/branch/commit or direct URL)
- Any special configuration required to reproduce the issue
- Step-by-step instructions to reproduce the issue
- Proof-of-concept or exploit code (if possible)
- Impact of the issue, including how an attacker might exploit the issue

This information will help us triage your report more quickly.

### Response Process

1. **Acknowledgment**: We'll acknowledge receipt of your vulnerability report within 48 hours.

2. **Assessment**: We'll assess the vulnerability and determine its severity and impact.

3. **Development**: If the vulnerability is confirmed, we'll develop a fix.

4. **Release**: We'll release a patched version and publish a security advisory.

5. **Recognition**: We'll publicly recognize your responsible disclosure (if desired).

### Preferred Languages

We prefer all communications to be in English.
